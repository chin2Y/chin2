In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nChin2 is a coder #works@self #selfemployer. Chin2 likes working with different technology. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
